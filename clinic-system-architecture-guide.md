# Building a Network-Based Desktop Clinic Management System

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide for building a professional clinic management system that combines the power of web technologies with native desktop application reliability. The system serves multiple users on a local network while maintaining data on-premises for healthcare compliance.

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

The system consists of three main layers:

1. **Desktop Control Application (Kotlin)**
   - System service management
   - Configuration management  
   - Network and file system operations
   - User-friendly GUI for administrators

2. **Web Application Server (Next.js)**
   - Business logic and patient management
   - Database operations
   - REST API endpoints
   - Web-based user interfaces

3. **Local Database (SQLite)**
   - Patient records and appointments
   - User authentication data
   - System configuration storage

### Network Architecture

## Phase 3: Installation and Deployment Strategy

### Installer Architecture

**Desktop Installer Package Contents:**
```
clinic-management-installer/
├── kotlin-desktop-app.jar
├── node-runtime/
│   ├── node.exe (Windows)
│   └── node (Linux)
├── nextjs-app/
│   ├── Built Next.js application
│   ├── package.json
│   └── Dependencies
├── database/
│   └── Initial schema and seed data
├── config/
│   └── Default configuration templates
└── install-scripts/
    ├── windows-installer.exe
    └── linux-installer.sh
```

**Installation Process:**
1. Create application directories (`/opt/clinic-app/`)
2. Copy all application files to target locations
3. Install Node.js runtime and dependencies
4. Create system user for service (`clinic_app`)
5. Set up file permissions and security
6. Create systemd service (Linux) or Windows Service
7. Generate initial configuration files
8. Initialize SQLite database with schema
9. Create desktop shortcuts and system tray integration
10. Start services and verify functionality

### Service Configuration

**System Service Setup:**
- Service name: `clinic-management`
- Auto-start: Enabled on boot
- User account: Dedicated service user
- Working directory: `/opt/clinic-app/nextjs-app/`
- Restart policy: Always restart on failure
- Logging: System journal integration

## Phase 4: Configuration Management

### Configuration Architecture

**Master Configuration (Kotlin-managed):**
